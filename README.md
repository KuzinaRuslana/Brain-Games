### About
Bored or tired? It's time to play! Meet the Brain Games — a pack of five vintage terminal games that will definitely boost your brainpower.

### Requirements
Requires PHP version 5.6.0 or greater and Composer.

### Installation
Use Composer to install the Brain Games. The following command will install it system-wide:
```bash
composer global require "example/brain-games"
```

### Getting started
Use 'make' commands. For instance:
```bash
make brain-games
```
Instead of `brain-games` you can use a name of the game you want to play. All games are listed below:
* **brain-even** — odd or even?
* **brain-calc** — what's the result of the expression?
* **brain-gcd** — what's the greatest common divisor?
* **brain-progression** — what number is missing in the progression?
* **brain-prime** — prime or not?
